    <h1>Sprint 12</h1>
    </p> This sprint is completed with more efficient code in the main.js (loop function), and a new design layout.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>When a friend was testing the application, they discovered an error with my undo button.</p>
    <p>When the undo button was clicked, the user was also able to undo actions by clicking on the rectangle canvas.</p>
    <p>What I did to fix this button was defined the Button.selectedShape as "" underneath in the Undo if statement in the control_draw.js, so the undo button was de-selected and</p>
    <p>you could not undo actions by pressing once on the button then on the canvas, like before.</p>
